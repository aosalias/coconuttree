<p>Take the challenge! The PADI Rescue Diver will expand your knowledge and experience beyond purely recreational level because you\\'ll learn to look beyond yourself and consider the safety and well being of other divers. Although this course is serious, it is an enjoyable way to build your confidence.\r<br />\r<br /><b>Why Rescue Diver?</b><br />While uncommon, emergencies in scuba diving do occasionally occur. The PADI Rescue Diver course trains you to anticipate and respond to a variety of diving-related emergency scenarios. By shifting the focus from your own personal safety to the general well-being of everyone in the water,  you will gain greater confidence in your own diving abilities while developing the mindset necessary to take your first steps towards becoming a <a href=\\\"dm.php\\\">PADI Divemaster</a>.\r<br />\r<br /><b>What do I need to start?</b><br />You must be at least 15 years old, in good physical health, certified as <a href=\\\"aow.php\\\">PADI Advanced Open Water</a> (or qualifying certification from another organization), and have successfully completed <a href=\\\"efr.php\\\">Emergency First Response</a> (or another sanctioned CPR program) within the last 24 months.

<p>Perfect for divers who want to maximize their bottom time! Due to the lower percentage of nitrogen in enriched air, your body absorbs less nitrogen during the dive, allowing you to stay underwater longer and minimizing those pesky surface intervals.\r<br />\r<br /><b>Why Enriched Air Nitrox?</b><br />If you\\\\\\'ve ever wanted to stay at depth longer than allowed by the air no-decompression limits, then the Enriched Air Nitrox Specialty is for you. Nitrogen is a big limiting factor on bottom time. With Enriched Air Nitrox, we reduce the amount of nitrogen in the breathing mixture by enriching the air with extra oxygen, which results in nearly 50% longer no-decompression limits. In short, you get more time to check out the fish and shipwrecks that reside at depth.\r<br />\r<br /><b>What do I need to start?</b><br />You must be at least 15 years old and be certified as a <a href=\\\\\\\"./rec/showcourse.php?abbr=ow\\\\\\\">PADI Open Water Diver</a> (or other qualifying certification). It is preferred that you already be certified as <a href=\\\\\\\"showcourse.php?abbr=aow\\\\\\\">PADI Advanced Open Water</a> or be enrolled in the course in order to reach the depths at which Enriched Air Nitrox is most beneficial. Good air consumption is a plus.\r<br />\r<br /><b>What will I do?</b><br />Enriched Air Nitrox carries a few additional risks versus air due to the higher oxygen content. The knowledge development sessions teach you how to analyze the oxygen content, anticipate the risk involved with oxygen, and plan your dives accordingly. The real fun comes on your two Enriched Air Nitrox dives, where you\\\\\\'ll still be checking out the sights of the deep long after the air divers have ascended to the shallows.\r<br />\r<br /><b>Tell me about the Advanced Open Water option.</b><br />The <a href=\\\\\\\"../rec/showcourse.php?abbr=aow\\\\\\\">PADI Advanced Open Water course</a> includes the Deep and Wreck Adventures dives, both deep dives that benefit from the extended bottom time from Enriched Air Nitrox. For example, at 33 meters/110 feet (the maximum depth of our two shipwrecks), you can reach a maximum bottom time of 25 minutes on EANx32 (32% O<sub>2</sub>, 68% N<sub>2</sub> mixture), as opposed to a mere 16 minutes on air. Enriched Air Nitrox can be combined with the Advanced Open Water course. The cost is $353 (plus books)!\r<br />\r<br /><b>How long will it take?</b><br />The Enriched Air Nitrox Specialty generally requires two days. Since a bulk of the course is knowledge development, expect at least one full afternoon reviewing the dive planning section of the specialty.\r<br />\r<br /><b>What do I earn at the end?</b><br />You will be certified for life as an Enriched Air Nitrox Diver, qualifying you to independently plan and conduct Enriched Air Nitrox dives with up to 40% oxygen to a maximum operating depth of 1.4 ata O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure.\r<br />\r<br /><b>Where can I go from here?</b><br />Diving, of course! You can request Enriched Air Nitrox tanks for your fun dives for only an additional $8 per tank. Also, the extended bottom time of Enriched Air Nitrox is excellent for many of the PADI specialty courses, especially <a href=\\\\\\\"showcourse.php?abbr=deep\\\\\\\">Deep Diver</a> and <a href=\\\\\\\"showcourse.php?abbr=wrck\\\\\\\">Wreck Diver</a>.</p>          \n\n\n\
