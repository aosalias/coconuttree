For example, at 33 meters/110 feet (the maximum depth of our two shipwrecks), you can reach a maximum bottom time of 25 minutes on EANx32 (32% O<sub>2</sub>, 68% N<sub>2</sub> mixture), as opposed to a mere 16 minutes on air. The <a href=\\\\\\\"eanx.php\\\\\\\">Enriched Air Nitrox specialty</a> can be combined with the Deep and Wreck Adventure dives of the Advanced Open Water course for only an additional $73 (plus books)!
<br />
<br /><b>How long will it take?</b><br />The full Advanced Open Water course can typically be completed in two days, with the possibility of a third day if you would rather be a bit more flexible on your vacation. If time is an issue, you can complete the Adventure Diver certification in a single day.
<br />
<br /><b>What do I earn at the end?</b><br />You will receive your permanent PADI Advanced Open Water certification card, which opens your range of diving opportunities all around the world.

<p>Emergency First Response gives you the tools you need to perform basic life support and first aid.

Emergency First Response is a prerequisite for the <a href=\"showcourse.php?abbr=resc\">PADI Rescue Diver course</a>.
<br />
<br /><b>Why Emergency First Response?</b><br />Emergencies can strike at any time; the Emergency First Response course prepares you to respond appropriately when they do. The skills learned in EFR allow you to extend the critical time window for a victim\'s survival. Since nearly 70% of life-threatening emergencies occur with family members or friends, the life you save may very well be someone close to you.

<br />

You will also practice first aid skills, such as injury and illness assessment, along with splinting and bandaging techniques. 
<br />
<br /><b>How long will it take?</b><br />The skills are performance-based and paced to meet your level of understanding. Since the focus is on skill recall in real-life scenarios, rather than skill perfection, you can take as much time as necessary to become comfortable. The average course takes about half a day to complete.
<br />
<br /><b>What do I earn at the end?</b><br />You will be certified for two years as an Emergency First Responder, an international basic emergency care qualification.

<p>Take the challenge! The PADI Rescue Diver will expand your knowledge and experience beyond purely recreational level because you\'ll learn to look beyond yourself and consider the safety and well being of other divers. Although this course is serious, it is an enjoyable way to build your confidence.
<br />
<br /><b>Why Rescue Diver?</b><br />While uncommon, emergencies in scuba diving do occasionally occur. The PADI Rescue Diver course trains you to anticipate and respond to a variety of diving-related emergency scenarios. By shifting the focus from your own personal safety to the general well-being of everyone in the water,  you will gain greater confidence in your own diving abilities while developing the mindset necessary to take your first steps towards becoming a <a href=\"dm.php\">PADI Divemaster</a>.

If you are between 12 and 14 or have a child between these ages, there is a PADI Junior Rescue Diver program available. PADI Junior Advanced Open Water along with current CPR training is required for PADI Junior Rescue Diver.
<br />
<br /><b>What will I do?</b><br />Rescue Diver training will prepare you to prevent problems and, if necessary, manage dive emergencies. Knowledge development sessions are followed by confined water skill training, where you will cover:</p><ul><li>Self-rescue and diver stress</li><li>Diving first aid</li><li>Emergency management and equipment</li><li>Swimming and non-swimming assists</li><li>Panicked diver response</li><li>Underwater problem solving</li><li>Surfacing the unconscious diver</li><li>In-water artificial respiration</li><li>Unconscious diver egresses (exits)</li><li>Missing diver searches</li></ul><p>Finally, all of these skills are reviewed during the challenging and entertaining open water rescue scenarios. You will also independently complete an Emergency Assistance Plan.
<br />
<br /><b>How long will it take?</b><br />The skills are performance-based and paced to meet your level of understanding. Since the focus is on skill recall in real-life scenarios, rather than skill perfection, you can take as much time as necessary to become comfortable. Allow three days to complete this course.
<br />
<br /><b>What do I earn at the end?</b><br />You will be certified for life as a PADI Rescue Diver, the second-highest recreational rating in the PADI system. You must have at least 20 logged dives before you can be awarded the Rescue Diver certification.
<br />
<br /><b>Where can I go from here?</b><br />The PADI Rescue Diver certification is a prerequisite for all professional-level PADI courses, beginning with <a href=\"dm.php\">PADI Divemaster</a>. If the professional route is not for you, you can work towards earning your PADI Master Scuba Diver rating, the highest recreational rating in the PADI system, by signing up for five <a href=\"spec.php\">PADI Specialty courses</a>. If you hold a PADI Rescue diver certification, five distinct PADI specialties, and 50 or more logged dives, you automatically qualify as a PADI Master Scuba Diver.</p>
