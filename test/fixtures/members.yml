    <p>Tree comes from Canada and wears many different hats around Coconut Tree Divers: repairing equipment, filling tanks, and most of all helping customers with all of their needs. He's the guy that coordinates the show and is most likely the first person to greet you upon entering the shop. As a diver of over ten years, he knows what you'll need to get the most out of your diving experience on Roatan.
    <br />
    <br />Prior to becoming shop manager, Tree snapped pictures of fish and divers as the dive shop photographer. His amazing photographs adorn the shop walls and he frequently accompanies aspring <a href="../courses/spec.php#photo">underwater photographers</a> to help them line up the perfect shot.
    <br />
    <br />Tree graduated with Honors from the Seagull School of Management. He loves his country (just check out the tattoo on his chest) and helping the beautiful "bikinifish" that walk in the shop.</p>

With a strong passion for the ocean he decided to complete his Open Water course in 1998. It wasn't long before he completed the Rescue Course.

Worked as a Divemaster for about five years and then met Will, "the best course directer on the island here at coconut tree" who took him through the Instructor Development Course/ Instructor Examination. George started working at Coconut Tree Divers in December 2009.
    <br />
